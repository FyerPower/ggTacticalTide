[COLOR="PaleGreen"][B][U]TacticalTide[/U][/B] is now under new management.  The original author, [U]SkyByte[/U], has lost interest in the game as many have and has stopped development on this add-on.  I, [U]Gamegenius86[/U], felt this add-on has potential and decided to take it over.  I have several plans for this add-on and will hopefully be digging into the code to fix & add new features.[/COLOR]

[B]TacticalTide[/B] is your all-in-one solution for your tactical warfare needs.  

TT focuses on gameplay in the alliance war (PvP), although it is still beneficial in PvE.
